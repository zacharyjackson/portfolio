    <h1>I'm Zach</h1>
    <p>I'm an aspiring web developer currently residing in Nashville, TN</p>
    <p>I currently work as an apprentice electrician. I have always had a drive
      for creating and problem solving, and this field gives me an outlet for
      that. However, programming is my passion. For years I have tinkered with
      building my own websites and web applications. I have recently buckled down
      and am investing time into mastering web development. Check back here for
    updates as I begin logging my learning and showcasing my projects.</p>
